The [Load Balancers (ELB)](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) are some pre-configured instances automatically distributing the incoming traffic across multiple EC2 Instances.

Simply drag a load balancer from the Resources panel then drop it outside of the Availability Zones.

You can then link the load balancer to the instances.<br />
At this point, you will be asked to configure the security rules between the load balancer and the target instances.

You can configure the load balancers on the right panel.
