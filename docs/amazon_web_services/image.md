Images represent the [EC2 Instances](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) with the [AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/amis) of your choice. There are 3 categories:

- `QuickStart`: the quickstart AMIs prebaked with [VisualOps OpsAgent](../reference/opsagent.md)
- `My`: the private AMIs in your AWS account
- `Favorite`: your collection of favorite community AMIs
