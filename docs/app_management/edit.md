# Edit Running App


You can edit the running apps by clicking on the 'Edit App' button (top-right)

The view will change to something pretty similar to the stack edition view<br />
You can edit your application here, as if it were a stack (with a few restrictions)

Once this is done, you can either save the changes by clicking on 'Apply' or discard them by clicking on the red cross

    NOTE: when you update a running app, as long as you are only changing the states and not the resources, the appâ€™s update operation will be exceptionally fast.
