# Track App Changes

You can turn on the `App Monitor` on your app to discover any external changes made to the resources. When any changes are spotted, an email will be sent to notify you. This feature is helpful to monitor your critical environments.

To change this setting, open the app, click `Edit App`, goto `Property Panel`, check the following box:

And a sample of the change report email looks like:

    NOTE:
    - The scan interval is 30 mins.
    - Only running apps will be scanned. However, you can turn on/off this feature to any app.
