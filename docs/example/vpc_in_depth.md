# VPC in depth

### Overview of VPC and AWS Platforms
A Virtual Private Cloud (or VPC) is a virtual network of logically isolated EC2 instances and an optional VPN connection to your own datacenter. This allows greater security than the classic EC2 system. Amazon announced that they are changing to VPC by default to all new users on a region by region basis. Thus, we decided to support only VPC based applications.
