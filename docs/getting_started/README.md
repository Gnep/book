# Getting Started

VisualOps is similar to AWS CloudFormation or OpenStack HEAT: design and provision of infrastructure and applications in the cloud. It automates:

- Infrastructure provisioning
- Code deployment
- Configuration management

The difference is that **VisualOps manages your app 24/7 to ensure that the app always run in the desired state, by continually monitor the infrastructure and the app, to instantly spot and fix any drift**.

VisualOps can be used for the following cases:
- Template-based provisioning: fast and repeatable Dev/QA, Demo environment setup
- Continuous Deployment: launch your stack into fully functioning app, VisualOps deploys your code and automatically upgrades it once there is a newer version
- App Ensure: design, launch and relax. VisualOps will ensure your app is always up and running in the state you defined
