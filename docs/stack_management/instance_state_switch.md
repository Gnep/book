# Instance State Switch

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MadeiraCloud/docs-image/master/ide_stack_state_switch.png)

In order to activate the states execution on your app, you need to ensure the 'Instance states switch' is turned on in the stack.

**NOTICE**:
- When 'Instance states' is on, the instance userdata will be overwritten to deploy our agent
- When an app is launched with 'Instance states' off, there is no option to turn it on
