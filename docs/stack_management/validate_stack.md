# Validate Stack Design

At any time you can check the validity of your stack by clicking on the bottom-right button 'Validate'

This feature will use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/">TrustedAdvisor</a> to give you advice as well as notify you of any actual and/or potential errors on your stack

You can also review your stack when starting it (a stack with actual errors can not be launched)
